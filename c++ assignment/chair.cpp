/*Suppose you give a dinner party for six guests, but your table seats only four. In how many 
ways can four of the six guests arrange themselves at the table? Any of the six guests can 
sit in the first chair. Any of the remaining five can sit in the second chair. Any of the 
remaining four can sit in the third chair, and any of the remaining three can sit in the fourth 
chair. (The last two will have to stand.) So the number of possible arrangements of six 
guests in four chairs is 6*5*4*3, which is 360. Write a program that calculates the number 
of possible arrangements for any number of guests and any number of chairs. (Assume 
there will never be fewer guests than chairs.) Donâ€™t let this get too complicated. A simple 
for loop should do it*/
